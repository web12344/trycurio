## SICSA Education Workshop

We are excited to announce a **SICSA education workshop** on using Curio – a smartphone-powered robotics platform for hands-on artificial intelligence and programming activities in the classroom.

The hands-on workshop will be held on **Tuesday January 30th 2024 (9.30am to 2pm)** at the [University of Glasgow – School of Computing Science](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rWCDCary3sqTxmtH7). The workshop is open to computing and robotics educators and PhD students from Scottish universities who are keen to explore this new platform.

Participants will get first-hand experience programming Curio and will brainstorm together curriculum activities around the robots. The workshop sessions will be led by [Dr. Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com), [Dr. Mireilla Bikanga Ada](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/mireillabikangaada/), and [Talha Enes Ayranci](https://talhayranci.com/) of the University of Glasgow.

The Curio platform offers an affordable way to teach coding, AI, and robotics. Students can program the robot directly via a webpage with access to all sensors. Students can learn to turn the robot into a self-driving car via computer vision or learn principles of user interface by designing and testing tactile controllers for Curio.

**Registration is limited to 20 participants** in order to provide the best hands-on experience. Attendance is free with tea and lunch provided. Travel cost will be reimbursed.

Find the detailed activities for the workshop [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19iu2C05iWUsMf_X7Ydq1fcTGqHo8CQBUEQvmkxjEs4Y/edit?usp=sharing).

For any questions, please email the organisers at [jonathan.grizou@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:jonathan.grizou@glasgow.ac.uk).

We look forward to welcoming fellow computing educators to Glasgow for a day of creative thinking on teaching computing topics through Curio’s applied robotics approach!
